# NIXL Prometheus Telemetry exporter plug-in

This telemetry exporter plug-in exports NIXL telemetry events in Prometheus format, by exposing an HTTP endpoint that can be scraped by Prometheus servers.
More detailed information on NIXL telemetry [docs/telemetry.md](../../../../docs/telemetry.md).

## Dependencies

The Prometheus exporter requires the prometheus-cpp library, which is included as a subproject.

libcurl is not downloaded automatically. To build, you need to install the libcurl package:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
# RHEL/CentOS/Fedora
sudo dnf install libcurl-devel
```

## Configuration

To enable the Prometheus plug-in, set the following environment variables:

```bash
export NIXL_TELEMETRY_ENABLE="y" # Enable NIXL telemetry
export NIXL_TELEMETRY_EXPORTER="prometheus" # Sets which plug-in to select in format libtelemetry_exporter_${NIXL_TELEMETRY_EXPORTER}.so
```

### Optional Configuration

You can restrict which metrics are exported with an allowlist (unset exports everything):

```bash
# Comma-separated glob allowlist matched against the base event names.
# A name selects every series for that event (counter, gauge, and the
# transfer-time histogram where applicable). Unmatched tokens are ignored
# with a warning; deactivated metrics are skipped before staging.
export NIXL_TELEMETRY_ENABLED_METRICS="agent_tx_bytes,agent_rx_bytes,agent_err_*"
```

You can configure the exposed prometheus port:

```bash
# Default port is 9090
export NIXL_TELEMETRY_PROMETHEUS_PORT="<port_num>"
```

Default addres is public, but you configure to expose prometheus endpoint only on localhost:

```bash
export NIXL_TELEMETRY_PROMETHEUS_LOCAL="y"
# Can be set to `y`/`yes`/`on`/`true`/`enable`/`1` to enable local only, and `n`/`no`/`off`/`false`/`disable`/`0` (or not set) to disable. Matching is case insensitive.
```

You can alter where to look for plug-in .so files
NOTE: the same var is used for backend plug-ins search

```bash
export NIXL_PLUGIN_DIR="path/to/dir/with/.so/files"
```

### Multi-process runs

The exporter opens one HTTP scrape endpoint per process. Under multi-process runs (e.g. tensor or data parallelism) every rank process tries to bind the same `NIXL_TELEMETRY_PROMETHEUS_PORT`; only one wins. Losing that race is benign and non-fatal: the affected process logs a single warning and runs **without** a telemetry sink (agent construction still succeeds, the model still runs). Only the process that bound the port exports metrics. To aggregate every rank behind one endpoint instead, use the [`prometheus_mp`](../prometheus_mp/README.md) exporter.

### Metrics & Events

| Event Name | Counter | Gauge | Histogram |
| ---------- | ------- | ----- | --------- |
| `agent_memory_registered` | Yes | Yes | No |
| `agent_memory_deregistered` | Yes | Yes | No |
| `agent_tx_bytes` | Yes | Yes | No |
| `agent_rx_bytes` | Yes | Yes | No |
| `agent_tx_requests_num` | Yes | No | No |
| `agent_rx_requests_num` | Yes | No | No |
| `agent_xfer_time` | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `agent_xfer_post_time` | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `agent_telemetry_events_dropped` | Yes | No | No |
| Error event types (`agent_err_*`) | Yes | No | No |

**Counter, Gauge, Histogram** - as implemented by the Prometheus exporter

- **Counter**: Instance lifetime count of the related value. Summed over the separate events' values. Counter metrics have suffix '_total'
- Error events are exposed as one labeled counter: `agent_errors_total{status="..."}`. The `status` label is bounded by the fixed `AGENT_ERR_*` event set.
- `agent_telemetry_events_dropped_total` is the cumulative count of telemetry events dropped at the producer-side staging queue (when the queue is full and an event cannot be enqueued for export). It does not count BUFFER cyclic-ring loss.
- **Gauge**: Shows the value per the last event (transaction) and can grow or decrease as each event updates it. The byte gauges follow the `agent_<subject>_last_<unit>` convention (the `_last` qualifier precedes the unit, keeping it distinct from the cumulative `_total` counter of the same base name): `agent_tx_last_bytes` / `agent_rx_last_bytes` carry the byte size of the latest TX/RX request, while `agent_tx_bytes_total` / `agent_rx_bytes_total` carry the running total. The memory gauges follow the same convention -- `agent_memory_registered_last_bytes` / `agent_memory_deregistered_last_bytes` -- and report the byte size of the last (de)registration, distinct from the cumulative `agent_memory_registered_total` / `agent_memory_deregistered_total` counters. The transfer-time events likewise publish both a cumulative `_total` counter and a last-operation gauge (`agent_xfer_time` / `agent_xfer_post_time`).
- **Histogram**: Counts the number of observations per pre-defined bins. Please see [Prometheus histograms documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/histograms/) for more details. The transfer-time events additionally publish latency-distribution histograms `agent_xfer_time_us` and `agent_xfer_post_time_us` (microseconds), exposed as the usual `_bucket{le="..."}` / `_sum` / `_count` series alongside the existing counter and gauge. Bucket boundaries default to a microsecond range covering ~10us..~10s and can be overridden (see below).

### Histogram buckets

The default bucket boundaries for the transfer-time histograms can be overridden with a comma-separated list of strictly-increasing positive microsecond upper bounds:

```bash
export NIXL_TELEMETRY_HISTOGRAM_BUCKETS_US="10,100,1000,10000,100000"
```

An absent or empty value uses the built-in defaults. A non-empty but invalid value (non-numeric, non-positive, or not strictly increasing) is rejected and the exporter fails to initialize, rather than silently falling back to the defaults.

### Metric labels

Each telemetry metrics is provided with the following labels:

- Hostname where the agent runs
- Agent name (as custom provided during initialization, can be deprecated in the next versions)
- `status` (only on `agent_errors_total`): the error kind, bounded by the fixed `AGENT_ERR_*` event set
