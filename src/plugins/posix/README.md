# NIXL POSIX Plugin

This backend provides POSIX-compliant I/O operations using either Linux AIO (libaio) by default
Optionally POSIX plugin can also use liburing.

**POSIX AIO (`use_posix_aio`) is deprecated.** Use Linux AIO (`use_aio`) or io_uring
(`use_uring`) for new deployments.

## File registration

`FILE_SEG` descriptors accept either fd-in-`devId` (fd-mode) or a
`"<modes>:<path>"` string in `metaInfo` (path-mode, backend owns the
open/close); see [`src/utils/file/README.md`](../../utils/file/README.md#path-mode-file-registration).

## Dependencies
To enable Linux AIO support, you need to install the libaio package:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install libaio-dev

# RHEL/CentOS/Fedora
sudo dnf install libaio-devel
```

### liburing

liburing support is enabled automatically via the Meson wrap under `subprojects/liburing.wrap` (pinned to WrapDB `liburing_2.14-1`). `meson setup` builds it from source when a system `liburing` is not found via pkg-config, so no manual install is required.

To use liburing with POSIX plugin use params["use_uring"] = "true"

# Running liburing with Docker
Docker by default blocks io_uring syscalls to the host system. These need to be explicitly enabled when running NIXL agents that use the posix plugin in Docker.

## Create a seccomp json file

```bash
$> wget https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/profiles/seccomp/default.json

# Add the following to the section, syscalls:names in default.json
# "io_uring_setup",
# "io_uring_enter",
# "io_uring_register",
# "io_uring_sync"

# Run docker with the new seccomp json file

$> docker run --security-opt seccomp=default.json -it --runtime=runc ... <imageid>
```
