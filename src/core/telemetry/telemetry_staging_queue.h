 * storage and its capacity reserve, the producer/consumer mutex, capacity
 * enforcement, all-or-none single and batch insertion, the swap-drain, and the
 * staging-drop counter. Metric semantics (activation, event selection, exporter
 * dispatch, synthetic dropped-event construction) stay in nixlTelemetry.
 *
 * Drop policy is drop-newest: once the queue is full an incoming event or batch
 * is rejected and counted as dropped; already-queued events are never
 * overwritten.
